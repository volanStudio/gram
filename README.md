# Gram
This is a low-level starting point for new web projects. It strives to solve for starting quickly and eliminating bloated code. Wholely inspired by (and flat-out rips) [Trim](https://github.com/mrmrs/trim) by Adam Morse

## Installation
This is a gulp-y project so installation and dependencies are handled within:

```
npm install -g gulp browser-sync
npm install .
```

## Running it
```
npm start
```
